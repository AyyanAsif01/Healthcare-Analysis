Dataset Overview and Data Preprocessing
The dataset for this project consists of healthcare records, including patient demographics, medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. Before performing the analysis, the dataset must undergo preprocessing steps such as cleaning data, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats. This ensures the dataset is ready for analysis.

Key Insights and Findings
By applying SQL queries to the healthcare dataset, valuable insights and findings can be obtained. These insights include identifying high-risk patient groups, evaluating treatment protocols’ effectiveness, understanding interventions’ impact on patient outcomes, and detecting patterns in disease prevalence or comorbidities. The analysis can also provide insights into resource allocation, such as optimizing hospital bed utilization or predicting patient demand for specialized services
